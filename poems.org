** The morning After I killed myself

The morning after I killed myself
I woke up
I made myself breakfast in bed.
I scrapped the ashes from the frying pan.
I washed the dishes and folded the towels

Not with boy down the street
not with the everyday jogger
With my father down at the river as he placed my note in the bottle and set it in the river
So we could play catch.
i stood by as strangers
as she once did for mine.
I went to the neighbours backyard
examined how they are already fading.
I saw her husband spit tobacco in the sink.
I watch the sun come up
each organge tree open like .
I went back to the body in the morgue and try to talk some sense into her.
I told her about the sunset and the dog and the beach
the mornig after i killed myself I try to unkill myslef because I coundn't finish what i started.


** The laughing heart by charles bukawokski

Love is a kind of like when you see the fog in the morning and when the sun comes up it burns away.
