'Hey', 'Hey, wake up?' said someone loudly.
"What?" I said in a sleepy voice.
"I said wake up" said the same person but rudely this time.
I opened my eyes and took in what was around me. I was in a bar. It's mostly empty. There was a man in front of me. He was tall and looked kinda pissed off.
"The bar has closed half an hour ago. I need to lock this place and go home. You have to get out of here, now" The bartender said to me. I stood up straightength my coat gave some money to him and walked to the door.

Outside, It was dark. I look at my watch. Almost midnight. I started walking alongside the road. It's foggy today. Can't see where I am going. The conversation I had with Micheal about two hours ago came rushing to me.
