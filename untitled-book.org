Her hair was dripping wet. Her lisps were red and wet, inviting me. She looked into my eyes. My whole world changed. I dove in for her lips. That was the biggest mistake of my life.

This is not a romantic story. This is a story of sadness and betreyal. So where to start.

"Hi, I am Josh" - I said to the girl setting beside me on the train.
